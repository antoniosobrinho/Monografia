abstract = "This paper proposes a more realistic multi-period liner ship fleet planning problem for a liner container shipping company than has been studied in previous literature. The proposed problem is formulated as a scenario-based dynamic programming model consisting of a number of integer linear programming formulations for each single planning period, and the model can be solved efficiently by a shortest path algorithm on an acyclic network. A numerical example is carried out to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model and solution method. The numerical results show that chartering in ships may not always be a better policy for a long-term planning horizon though it is much cheaper than buying ships in the short-term. Purchasing ships seems to be a more profitable investment in the long run. "

To solve this problem, we investigate the practical operational issues of \{SRPTP\} and develop a genetic algorithm. The empirical studies demonstrate the applicability of the proposed solution scheme for solving real-world problems that are beyond the reach of a widely used commercial optimization package. The technical, computational, practical and calibration issues involved in this unique tramp shipping problem are discussed in detail in this paper. "

The second phase applies fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to compare alternatives in terms of the structure established in the first phase. The case of the newest terminal at Kaohsiung port is studied empirically and the 40-foot twin-lift Q/C is chosen as the most suitable alternative. "

The results obtained confirm the vital role that frequency plays in the relative competitiveness of rail transport and also provide subjective values of transport attributes that are deemed essential for an accurate cost-benefit analysis.

An interesting bifurcation is found with regard to the strategic foci of the \{LTL\} market niche and firm size growth, with the former of these two strategic foci having a positive impact on operating efficiency and the latter having a positive impact on technological change.

The results also suggest that excellence in operations is more important than wide-ranging service provision. Furthermore, the research suggests that the range of service provision offered by 3PLs does not directly influence the 3PLs’ financial performance. However, 3PL providers with service capabilities that correspond to the key priorities of customers will gain superior financial performance through a better operational performance. Similarities and differences between logistics practices in the \{UK\} and Taiwan are highlighted. "
